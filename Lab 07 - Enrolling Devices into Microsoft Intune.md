   _Note: This view lists devices that are enrolled to Intune. Remember that you configured automatic enrollment between Entra and Intune, and because of that, any device that is joined or registered to Entra is automatically enrolled to Intune. Any devices joined prior to setting up enrollment are only joined or registered to Entra, but not enrolled in Intune._

7. Open a new tab in **Microsoft Edge**, in the address bar type **https://entra.microsoft.com**, and then press **Enter**.

8. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, in the navigation pane, select **Devices**, then select **All devices**. 

   > Take note of SEA-WS1. Notice that the Join Type column displays **Microsoft Entra joined** and the MDM column displays **Microsoft Intune**.
